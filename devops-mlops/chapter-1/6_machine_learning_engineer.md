### Emergence of MLOps Engineer

- **Machine Learning Engineer**: A Machine Learning Engineer focuses on designing, building, and deploying machine learning models. They work closely with data scientists to implement algorithms and ensure that models are production-ready.
- **MLOps Engineer**: An MLOps Engineer specializes in the operationalization of machine learning models. They focus on the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of models in production environments, ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficiency. MLOps Engineers bridge the gap between data science and IT operations, implementing best practices for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of machine learning systems.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - **Machine Learning Engineer**:
    - Develop and optimize machine learning algorithms.
    - Collaborate with data scientists to translate models into production code.
    - Ensure model performance and accuracy.
  - **MLOps Engineer**:
    - Design and implement CI/CD pipelines for machine learning models.
    - Monitor model performance in production and manage model versioning.
    - Automate the deployment process and ensure compliance with security standards.
- **Skills Required**:
  - **Machine Learning Engineer**:
    - Proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R.
    - Strong understanding of machine learning algorithms and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
    - Experience with data preprocessing and feature engineering.
  - **MLOps Engineer**:
    - Knowledge of DevOps practices and tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins).
    - Experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
    - Familiarity with monitoring tools and model management systems (e.g., MLflow, Seldon).
- **Collaboration**: Both roles require close collaboration with data scientists, software engineers, and IT teams to ensure the successful deployment and operation of machine learning models in production environments.

### Traditional ML Pipeline vs. Production ML System

- **Research Pipeline**:
    - Jupyter Notebooks
    - Local development
    - Ad-hoc experiments (manual tracking)
    - Manual processing and feature engineering

- **Production ML System**:
    - Automated pipelines (CI/CD)
    - Scalable infrastructure (cloud-based)
    - Continuous monitoring and logging
    - Automated feature engineering and data validation
    - Governance and compliance mechanisms

### The Buy vs. Build Decision

- **When to Buy a Platform**:
    - End-toEnd Data Scientists need comprehensive tools.
    - Limited in-house expertise in MLOps.
    - Early ML maturity stage.
    - Need for rapid deployment and scalability.
    - Budget allows for commercial solutions.

- **When to Build a Platform**:
    - Cross-functional teams with MLOps expertise.
    - Justifying long-term cost savings.
    - Unique business requirements not met by commercial solutions.
    - Data privacy and security concerns.
    - Advanced ML maturity stage.
