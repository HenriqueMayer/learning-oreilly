### Asking the Right Questions

- **For MLOps Projetcs**?
    - How will we track data and model versions?
    - What is our retraining strategy for model updates?
    - How will we monitor model drift? (Model Drift is the change in model performance over time due to changes in data patterns)
    - What is our deployment pipeline?

- **For LLMOps Projects**?
    - How will we manage prompts?
    - What retrieval strategy should we use?
    - How will we evaluate response quality?
    - How do we handle hallucinations?

- **For AgenticAIOps Projects**?
    - What tasks should the agent handle?
    - What tools and APIs does need access to?
    - How do we ensure task completion?
    - What safety measures are required?
